# Class 9 - Lab Assignment

Continue working on the functionality of your **sales.html** page if you do not have it working 100% yet, including the row of totals across the bottom.

Here's your other tasks for today:

- Continue with your own design that you've started on **index.html**.
- For your design, Pat INSISTS that you **must** use all of the images in the adjacent asset directory. *Every. Single. One.*
- Your public-facing page mockup in **index.html** should have all of the things you'd expect such a page to have for such a business: locations with addresses, hours open, contact information, and so us. Just make up versions of these things since this is not a real business, of course.
- You can also mock up references to (either links or little sections on the **index** page) for things like About Us (company history and mission), Merchandise (sales of t-shirts, mugs, stickers, etc.), links to salmon events like the Salmon Days in Issaquah, etc.

- Apply a similar style to the **sales.html** page.

	### Stretch Goals (Not required! Do either one, two, three, all, or none, in any order)

1. Give your input form functionality to update the data for a location that is already in the table. This is going to require some additional pieces, such as:
	- Some kind of `if` statement to test whether the inputted cookie stand location name matches one that is already in the table (or other mechanism to indicate which location to update)
	- The new input numbers need to be run through the calculation methods as with the original creation of the instances

2. As a developer, to demonstrate to my client my ability to add value, I will create a second table that will help Pat manage staffing. Using the basic rubric that a single Salmon Cookie Tosser can serve 20 customers per hour, and that each location should have a minimum of two Salmon Cookie Tossers on shift at all times, calculate how many Salmon Cookie Tossers are needed at each location each hour.

3. Make a style guide, using [this one that a team that CF instructor Brian Nations was on built for Everlast](http://everlast.com/style-guide) as a model.
